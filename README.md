# Student-Attendance-System

# The aim and objectives of this project

The system should be able to detect students’ frontal faces in a classroom within 30% accuracy. Recognise student stored on a database of faces by matching them to images on a database with an accuracy within 30%.
The system should be able to match detected students faces cropped from an image to those on a database on the system. The system should be able to detect face and recognise when in range.
The algorithm implemented for the system’s functionality will achieve system accuracy within 20%.
The system designed will be user friendly with a Graphical User Interphase that will serve as an access to the functionalities of the system.

# Scope of the project.

The project encompasses a Face Recognition-based Attendance System developed using Python with Tkinter for the graphical user interface, OpenCV for face detection, and Pandas for data management. It offers functionalities such as user authentication, allowing password changes for security. Users can register new students by providing their IDs and names, with the system capturing their images for face recognition. Utilizing Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and LBPH Face Recognizer for recognition, the system tracks attendance by recognizing registered students and records their details along with the date and time. Data is managed through CSV files, displayed using a Treeview widget in the GUI. The interface includes features like clear buttons, help documentation access, and displays the current date and time. With error handling mechanisms and support options provided, the system aims for efficiency, scalability, and ease of maintenance, offering a reliable solution for managing student attendance.
